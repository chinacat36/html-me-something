<h1>My Most Recent Trip: Oregon</h1>
<p>Through the years, many friends have found new lives in different cities across the United States.  Although I miss them, it presents a great opportunity to visit and explore a different area.  I love to travel.  My most recent visit was to Oregon. I was able to visit:

			<h2>Portland, Oregon</h2>
			<p>
				I flew into Portland, Oregon to begin my journey. Having never been to the airport before, I was astonished at how nice it was. As I was walking out, I resisted the urge of hitting the raw bar and indulging in some oysters, something I would never consider doing at an airport. My friends drove up from Grant's Pass so we could all see Lizzo together, a beautiful start to a girl's weekend.  The venue she performed at was the McMenamins Edgefield. It was a gorgoeous outdoor venue surronded by trees.  As we danced with big smiles on our faces, the sun set behind the stage.  It was truly a night to remember.

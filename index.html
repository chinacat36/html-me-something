<h1>My Most Recent Trip: Oregon </h1>
<p class="p1" id="intro" >
	Through the years, many friends have found new lives in different cities across the United States.  Although I miss them, it presents a great opportunity to visit and explore a different area.  I love to travel.  My most recent visit was to Oregon. I was able to visit:

			<h2>Portland</h2>
			<p>
				I flew into Portland, Oregon to begin my journey. Having never been to the airport before, I was astonished at how nice it was. 
				As I was walking out, I resisted the urge of hitting the raw bar and indulging in some oysters, something I would never consider doing at an airport.  
				A few friends drove up from Grant's Pass so we could all see Lizzo together, a beautiful start to a girl's weekend.  The venue she performed at was the McMenamins Edgefield.  
				It was a gorgoeous outdoor venue surronded by trees.  As we all danced with big smiles on our faces, the sun set behind the stage.  It was truly a night to remember.

<h2>Grant's Pass</h2>
<p>
	After a wonderful night in Portland, we loaded up the cars and drove south.  I would finally get to see where two of my best friends, Taylar and Allison, now call home.  
	As we arrive in town, I am told my friends live 30 - 40 minutes from each other.  Due to the mountainous landscape; many places, including grocery stores and typical everyday-needs-type places, are this far away.  
	This is definetely something to get used to, however not a bad trade for the amazing views.

			<h2>Rogue River</h2>
			<p>
				The following day, Taylar's mother-in-law-to-be arranged a float trip for us down the Rogue River.  I was excited, but had no idea how wonderful it would be. 
				 Growing up in St. Louis, I am fond of float trips, but had never been on such a huge river.  It was a perfect day.  The sun was shining and it was hot.  
				 As we ventured down the river, large trees towered over us.  The river was wide, full of movement and life.  The water was very deep.  This would be a day of firsts! 
				 I experienced a bit of white water rafting for the first time.  Luckily I was with people that had grown up in the area, and were used to the rapid waters.
			    You really had to hold on tight, or the river would take you!  Another first, was seeing a (baby) otter.
				It was so cute, but I was told they can be rather vicious and temperamental.  Either way, I was happy to see it.

			<h2>The Oregon Coast</h2>
			<p>
			My last day in Oregon was spent traveling the Oregon Coast down to the the most northern part of California. 
			I was able to see a bit of the Redwood National Forest and the Pacific coastline. It was evident we were drawing near to the forest, as the trees began to stetch into the sky.  
			As we walked into the forest, we became engrossed by the depths of wisdom and size of the trees. It was mesmerizing!  
			Sadly, we had to leave in order to make the most of our day. We hopped back in the car and dressed Kingston, their weiner dog in a life vest.  
			Traveling back north, up the coast, we stopped whenever we could to explore. Most of the coastline is rocky with trees looming nearby.  
			However, we found a hidden pathway off the highway that led to one of the most beautiful views I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  
			We followed a dirt path about a 1/4 of a mile down to a closed off, almost-private, beach area. It was gorgeous.

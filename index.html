<h1><b>My Most Recent Trip: Oregon</b></h1>

<p>Through the years, many friends have found new lives in different cities across the United States.  Although I miss them, it presents a great opportunity to visit and explore a different area.  I love to travel.  My most recent visit was to Oregon. I was able to visit:

<b>Portland</b>

<b>Grant’s Pass</b>

<b>Rogue River</b>

…and traverse the <b>Southern Oregon Coast.</b>
